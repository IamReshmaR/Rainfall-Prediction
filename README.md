Rainfall Forecasting Model Project

Overview:

This project is developed for an Australian weather forecasting company with the aim to enhance their market share by providing superior weather forecasts. The model leverages extensive meteorological data to predict the likelihood of rain, thus supporting better decision-making for businesses and individuals, enhancing user experience, driving revenue growth, and strengthening the company's brand reputation.

Business Objectives:

- Increase Market Share: Utilize predictive models to capture a larger share of the weather app market.
- Improve Decision Support for Clients: Provide accurate weather prediction tools for informed decision-making.
- Enhance User Experience: Deliver user-friendly and accurate forecasts through the company's weather app.
- Drive Revenue Growth: Monetize predictive capabilities through various revenue streams including subscriptions and partnerships.
- Strengthen Brand Reputation: Establish the app as the most reliable weather forecasting tool available.
- Expand B2B Services: Offer tailored weather-related services to sectors such as agriculture, shipping, and outdoor event planning.
  
Technical Objectives:

- Data Collection: Gather comprehensive data on wind speed, temperature, humidity, etc., from various weather stations across Australia.
- Data Cleansing: Implement preprocessing steps to normalize and transform data for model training.
- Data Visualization: Develop a dynamic dashboard for clients to identify weather patterns and trends.
- Machine Learning Models: Use logistic regression and random forest algorithms to predict the occurrence of rain the next day.
- Model Selection: Evaluate models based on their predictive accuracy and choose the best fit based on client needs.

Models Developed:

- Logistic Regression: For maximizing the identification of actual rainy days (higher recall).
- Random Forest: Chosen for its higher overall accuracy and precision in reducing false positives.

Conclusions:

The project has set a new standard for weather forecasting in Australia, utilizing a rich dataset and advanced modeling techniques to aid in critical decision-making across weather-sensitive sectors.
